DISCLAIMER:
 
The MODEL provided herein represents GEM's interpretation of the original model
proposed by Wesson et al. (2007)  (hereafter indicated as the ORIGINAL MODEL).
It was created by GEM, in the attempt of reproducing in the most faithful way
possible the ORIGINAL MODEL but IT IS NOT intended to be an alternative nor a
replacement implementation of the ORIGINAL MODEL. 
 
The MODEL is released as an OpenQuake-engine tailored implementation on behalf
of scientists and engineers working within the GEM Foundation (Global
Earthquake Model).
 
GEM provides it recognizing importance, authoritativeness and, transparency of
the ORIGINAL MODEL, for the purpose of open collaboration and in the hope that
it will be useful to the scientific, engineering, disaster risk and software
design communities.
 
The MODEL is therefore provided WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied 
warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
The GEM Foundation, and the authors of the MODEL, assume no liability for  its use.

For additional information, material and documentation about the ORIGINAL MODEL 
we warmly invite the user to consult publications and website of the United 
States Geological Survey (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/)
