Stochastic Event-based Damage Demo
----------------------------------

In this example, we study the sensitivity of an event based damage
calculation with 50 samples takes from 486 realizations from the
`random_seed` parameter.

**Expected Runtimes and Outputs**

Expected runtime for event damage calculation: < 10 minutes

Outputs:

- Aggregate Risk Curves
- Aggregated Risk By Event
- Asset Damage Distributions
- Earthquake Ruptures
- Ground Motion Fields
