Liquefaction and Landslide models
=================================

Liquefaction models
-------------------

Several liquefaction models are implemented in the OpenQuake engine. 
One of them is the method developed for the HAZUS software by the US 
Federal Emergency Management Agency. This model involves categoriza-
tion of sites into liquefaction susceptibility classes based on geo-
technical characteristics, and a quanitative probability model for 
each susceptibility class. The remaining models are the academic 
geospatial models, i.e., statistical models that uses globally avai-
lable input variables as first-order proxies to characterise satura-
tion and density properties of the soil. The shaking component is 
expressed either in terms of Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) or Peak 
Ground Velocity (PGV).
