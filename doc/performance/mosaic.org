* Improvements on the mosaic classical PSHA calculations

** The Canada 2015 model

In version 3.14 of the engine the tabular GMPEs were optimized by
moving the interpolation of IMT and magnitude in the controller node
and not in the worker nodes, i.e. outside an inner loop.
That allowed a substantial performance improvement in =computing mean_std=,
see the plot below.

Other operations became slightly slower having allocated larger memory
blocks to speedup as much as possible =computing mean_std=.
